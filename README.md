# IN PROGRESS

# Java-Course-Complete

## Getting Started

This Repo is including my studies based on some advanced Java Training topics. I have included two folder which named Presentations and Source Code. Presentations have generally explanations of the topic. Source code folder has sample codes which were built to make you understand on a better way.


## Prerequisites

I would like to suggest Junior Engineers or  Developers and students to use this repo as a good road map. 
With content, you will be able to cover almost all of the most important concepts that a software company uses in the professional way. 
Not to lose time, it would be better to focus on concepts as soon as possible. 
This way will be much easier to handle with real life applications source codes.
